  <h4>Automation Infrastructure Intern</h4>
  <p>
    Apple is one of the largest companies in the world with a focus on consumer electronics and software.
    <br><br>
    I began working at Apple as an intern in 2018 on the Apple Pay team. Here I learned a vast amount of information regarding streamlined processes that are constantly being perfected.
    <br><br>
    I worked on projects that revolved around data aggregation, data visualization, and automation at Apple. I explored full stack development using EmberJS, Python Flask, and MongoDB; I built out code coverage modules for automated testing; and I worked on the day-to-day operations of being on an automation systems team.
