    <h3>Rookie Road</h3>
  </a>
  <h4>Manager of Automation</h4>
  <p>
    Rookie Road is an online website which teaches the rules, lingo, and gameplay of various sports in an easy to understand way.<br><br>
    Working at Rookie Road gave me a taste of the fast-paced world of technology startups. As a company that focuses on content creation, Rookie Road's technology team started small with just two people.<br><br>
    I began by building out a library of useful scripts and programs. As automation proved more and more valuable to Rookie Road, the chief product officer and I designed and developed the continuous integration pipeline that persistently deploys the site.
