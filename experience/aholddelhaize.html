  <h4>Emerging Technologies Developer (Co-op)</h4>
  <p>
    Ahold Delhaize is one of the largest retail conglomerates in the world, with over 6000 grocery stores and multiple e-commerce grocery platforms.<br><br>

    I worked in the Innovation Lab locate in Quincy, Massachusetts. As a part of the Emerging Technologies, my work focused on Internet of Things solutions for deployment in brick-and-mortar stores. This involved API and backend programming in Python, computer vision programming in Python, data analytics and visualization in R and Python, and microcontroller programming in Arduino and C.<br><br>

    While working at Ahold Delhaize my team and I invented an automated checkout system that used customer device data. I am filed as an original inventor on the <a href="http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=OR&d=PG01&s1=%22AUTOMATED+CHECKOUT+SYSTEM+USING+INFORMATION+CUSTOMER+DEVICE%22.TTL.&OS=TTL/%22AUTOMATED+CHECKOUT+SYSTEM+USING+INFORMATION+FROM+CUSTOMER+DEVICE%22&RS=TTL/%22AUTOMATED+CHECKOUT+SYSTEM+USING+INFORMATION+FROM+CUSTOMER+DEVICE%22" target="_blank">patent</a>.
